  Ring, Gift For Her, Birthday Gift, Bridesmaid Gifts, New Beginnings, Stacking Ring.\n\nA
  beautiful handmade wire wrapped ring made with a 6mm Black Moonstone gemstone and
  Stainless  Steel  Hypoallergenic Wire.  \n\nDue to the natural composition of these
  stones no two are ever the same.  The one you will receive will be the same quality
  as the one in the photos however the pattern or markings may differ. \n\nAll photos
  have been enlarged to show close up details. \n\nPlease check out the ring size
  charts the in the photos to help you choose the correct size of ring.  If you are
  unsure of your ring size please see chart in the photos for measuring instructions.
  \ I can make these rings from US sizes 5 to 13 including half sizes.\n\nBlack Moonstone
  holds the energy of the New Moon and new beginnings. Whether it's the start of a
  new project, a new pregnancy or setting new intentions, this is a wonderful stone
  to connect with during that new moon period. \n\nWhen you work with black moonstone
  in sync with the moon's cycle, it helps to cut through your internal layers, shedding
  light on the thoughts and patterns you need to let go of in order to pave your pathway
  to greatness. It also has a gentle protective and grounding energy that is not as
  prevalent in other types of Moonstone. \n\nPresented in an organza bag."
